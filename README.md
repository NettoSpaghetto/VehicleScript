Vehicle Script

Hey guys,

I often see a large amount of gmodstore jobs being posted for features which, to my knowledge, haven't been uploaded to the steam workshop yet. This addon aims to target one of those commonly requested addons, being a seatbelt function and an interactive engine!

ENGINE

Basically, when in a car, the engine no longer starts automatically, you must press H to start it. By pressing H again, you stop the car, and can no longer move it.

SEATBELT

When you press J while in a car, you can now put on your seatbelt! Similar to real life, when you try to exit the car with a seatbelt on, you will quickly find out that you can't! By pressing J again, you take off your seatbelt, and can safely exit the vehicle. Wearing a seatbelt reduces your damage by 4x.

Be sure to give this addon a thumbs up if you liked it, and add it to your favourites! That way, I know you guys want more!


Sounds are included, but are not made by me.
